AINS 3.0 (Current Edition - June 2025)

The upcoming edition of AINS, scheduled for June 13-15, 2025, will take place at El Ksar Resort & Thalasso in Sousse, Tunisia, under the theme "Democratizing Intelligence." This event serves as a platform for AI enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals to engage in workshops, competitions, and discussions on cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence. Attendees can register through the official website, ains.tn, to participate in a diverse range of activities designed to foster learning and collaboration.

The Organizing Committee comprises a dedicated team of professionals ensuring the smooth execution of the event. Fayez Zouari leads as Project Manager, supported by Makki Aloulou as Program Manager and Kacem Mathlouthi as Technical Manager. Other key roles include Aziz Amari managing the Poster Session, Ahmed Amin Chabbah overseeing community engagement, and Rayen Khammar handling event content. Additional team members such as Ons Squidi, Khar Ben Ayed, Anira Lahiani, Yessin Kolsi, Rakia Tsouri, Enna Harzallah, Baneb Kchaou, Aya Caha, and Mohamed Adbeiwahed contribute to logistics, communication, sponsorship, and financial management, ensuring a well-coordinated experience for all participants.

A network of Ambassadors from various academic and professional institutions plays a crucial role in promoting the event. Representatives from IEEE student branches across Tunisia, including Molka Attia (ESSTHS), Slim Selmi (SUPCOM), Emna Gammoudi (TEK-UP), and Rania Akrout (ENISO), among others, help bridge the gap between the organizing team and the broader AI community. Additionally, ambassadors from Google Developer Groups (GDG) and other tech communities, such as Nour Ben Brahim (ISAMM) and Ismail Rebai (ISIMS), further extend the event’s reach.

The Workshop Instructors and Sessions feature industry experts delivering hands-on training in specialized AI domains. Iheb Kesraoui, a machine learning engineer, will conduct a session on "AI Model Deployment: From Local to Cloud," covering deployment strategies across platforms like Docker Hub, AWS EC2, and GitHub Actions. Achref Ben Ammar, an ML engineer and co-founder of Aiklyra, will introduce the Transformer architecture, the backbone of models like GPT and BERT. Other notable workshops include Oussama Chelly’s session on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Besma Guesmi’s introduction to Computer Vision, and Mariem Alaoui’s exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The event will also host Confirmed Speakers who will share their expertise in AI research and applications. Hafedh Hichri, a Machine Learning Engineer at Mermory and Hugging Face Fellow, will present "Revolutionizing RAG with Chonkie," discussing his ultra-light Python library for efficient text chunking in RAG pipelines. Mohamed Arbi Nsibi, an ML Engineer at Carbon Insights, will delve into "Building Smarter RAG Pipelines with Qdrant," highlighting advanced retrieval techniques using the Qdrant vector store.

Event Components include a variety of interactive formats. Workshops provide hands-on learning, while the Hackathon and Data Science Competition encourage teamwork and problem-solving. The Conferences feature expert talks, and the Poster Session showcases student research. A new addition this year is the Research Tracks, focusing on key AI domains such as Generative AI, NLP, MLOps, Computer Vision, and Edge AI.

Attendees have the opportunity to compete for prizes across different categories. The Hackathon offers a total prize pool of 3,500 DT, with the winning team receiving 2,000 DT and AI internship positions at Orange Summer Challenge. The Data Science Competition awards 1,000 DT in prizes, while the Best Poster Session winner earns 500 DT.

The event is supported by prominent Sponsors and Partners, including IEEE Tunisia Section, Orange Digital Center, Vectors, GOMYCODE, and Thunder Code. Their contributions help enhance the experience for participants through funding, resources, and networking opportunities.

For those interested in attending, registration details are available on the official website, ains.tn, with additional information sessions conducted via Google Meet by the event ambassadors. AINS 3.0 promises to be an enriching experience for AI practitioners, students, and researchers, fostering innovation and knowledge-sharing in the field of artificial intelligence.
